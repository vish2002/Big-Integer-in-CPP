# Big-Integer-in-CPP

Implemented a basic Big Integer library in C++ to handle arithmetic operations on numbers exceeding 20 digits. Utilized linked lists to
manage large number storage and implemented algorithms for addition, subtraction. This project demonstrates proficiency in data structures, algorithms, and handling large-scale computations in
C++.

# Big-Integer-in-CPP

Implemented a basic Big Integer library in C++ to handle arithmetic operations on numbers exceeding 20 digits. Utilized linked lists to
manage large number storage and implemented algorithms for addition, subtraction. I also added a function to calculate Factorial of
the large number. This project demonstrates proficiency in data structures, algorithms, and handling large-scale computations in
C++.
